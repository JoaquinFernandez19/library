# FOR NOW IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE, IT DOSN'T SAVE YOUR BOOKS AFTER REFRESH
-Javascript
-Css
-Html

## functionality

This app is a library where you can write down every book you have readed or you
wish to read.
It includes a 'delete book' functionality where you can delete the selected book and also
you have a 'change read status' where you can change the status of the book
being 'finished' or 'unfinished' the options.

## future

I will try to store the books of every person in a data base/own local storage in the future
but right now i don't have the knowledge to do that in a 'clean way'.
